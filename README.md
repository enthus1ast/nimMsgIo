nimMsgIo

1. a modular, multi protocol, room based, message distribution server.
2. variouse clients (native, browser) for speaking agains the msgIo server.

Let clients join rooms and let them share messages between those rooms.


the structure of this library is as follow:

transports/
  ## implementing the actual protocols
  ## this library is able to speek
  transportWebSocket # transport for the websocket protocol, also implements http callbacks
  transportTcp       # transport for plain TCP (net syntax)
  transportUdp       # transport for plain UDP

serializer/
  ## implements the variouse serializers every transport can use to
  ## convert a msgIo object into the aproprirate(?) byte streams.
  ## Which can than be transfered over the transports communication channel
  serializerJson
  serializerMsgPack

# Join rooms
Clients can be grouped in "rooms". Every client can participate in multiple rooms. 
Clients can ask the server to join them in rooms. But the server has to fullfill this request. The default is that noone can join any rooms.

To let clients join rooms the programmer must call joinRoom `on the server`.
After this a client can send messages directly to the given room, the server
will then relay all messages send to this room to all participating clients. 


# Send to clients
Clients can send "directly" to another client. For this the sending client
must somehow know the other clients id. 
The programmer must exchange the other user client id in their protocol.
msgio has no build in concept of exchangeing clients.
